I am a future software engineer finishing up my final two years of high school at Morehead State University.
I know Python and am learning SQL, JavaScript, and C++.

I am involved in a research project, known as the N + k Queens Problem, at Morehead State.
From http://www.npluskqueens.info/, 

"Given a positive integer N and a nonnegative integer k,
can we place k pawns and N + k queens on an chessboard with 
N rows and N columns so that every pair of queens on the 
same row, column, or diagonal have at least one pawn between them?"

For this project, I am working on a brute-force program to find all solutions for a given N and k.


I started learning Python two years ago (when I first uploaded a program).
Then I did not upload any programs for two years and I have started again.
